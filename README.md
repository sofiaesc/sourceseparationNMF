<h1 align="center">Audio source separation with multiple instruments</h1>

<div align="justify">
  <p>This work is framed within the course of Digital Signal Processing, offered at FICH-UNL for the Computer Engineering program, serving as its final project.</p>
  <p>The <b>motivation</b> behind this project is to be able to separate different sources within an audio, whether for recreational purposes such as isolating instruments in a song to facilitate learning their notes individually, or for practical applications such as clearly separating voices to enhance the performance of cochlear implants for individuals with hearing impairment. We approached this matter with the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method, hoping to follow up the investigation with other methods in the future.</p>
  <p>The input data utilized were compiled by us, employing various sound generators and audio editing programs to extract individual instruments and their blends. The final code manages to separate the sources in audios with two or three sources, and we also experimented with the adding of noise. Both the results and the coding could be improved in future projects.</p>
  <p>We have made the source code available, along with various results and their corresponding audio outputs, convergence information, charts, and the final experiment report.</p>
